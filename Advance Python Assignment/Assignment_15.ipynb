    "**Ans:-** Some New Features Added in Python 3.8 Version are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Walrus Operator:** This operator is used to assign and return a value in the same expression. This removes the need for initializing the variable upfront. The major benefit of this is it saves some lines of code. It is also known as The Walrus Operator due to its similarity to the eyes and tusks of a walrus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**yield** and **return** statements do not require parentheses to return multiple values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reversed works with a dictionary. The built-in method **reversed()** can be used for accessing the elements in the reverse order of insertion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dict comprehensions** have been modified so that the key is computed first and the value second.\n",
    "\n",
    "**importlib_metadata** is a new **library** added in the Python’s standard utility modules, that provides an **API** for accessing an **installed package’s metadata**, such as its entry points or its top-level name.\n",
    "\n",
    "**f-strings** now support =, to make string **interpolation** easy. Python 3.8 allows the use of the above-discussed assignment operator and equal sign (=) inside the f-strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the **three-argument** form of **pow()**, when the exponent is **-1**, it calculates the **modular multiplicative inverse** of the given value\n",
    "\n",
    "The **csv.DictReader** now returns **instances of dictionary** instead of a collections.OrderedDict.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you **miss a comma** in your code such as a = [(1, 2) (3, 4)], instead of throwing TypeError, it displays an informative Syntax warning."
